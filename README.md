## Overview
The **Indonesia Node.js** repository provides a comprehensive database of Indonesian regions. It is built using Node.js, making it easy to integrate into various applications. This database includes data about provinces, cities, districts, and villages, allowing developers to create location-based services or applications.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Data**: Contains detailed information about all Indonesian provinces, cities, districts, and villages.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API endpoints for quick access to data.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, ensuring fast performance.
- **Community Driven**: Open to contributions from developers to enhance the database.

## Installation
To install the **Indonesia Node.js** database, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SMATHOSH/indonesia-nodejs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd indonesia-nodejs
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
After installation, you can start using the database in your Node.js application. Here’s a simple example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const regions = require('./data/regions.json');

app.get('/api/regions', (req, res) => {
    res.json(regions);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

This code sets up a basic Express server that serves the regions data at the `/api/regions` endpoint.

## Database Structure
The database is structured in a way that makes it easy to navigate and retrieve data. Here’s a brief overview of the structure:

- **Provinces**: Contains a list of all provinces in Indonesia.
- **Cities**: Contains data about cities within each province.
- **Districts**: Contains information about districts within each city.
- **Villages**: Contains data about villages within each district.

### Example JSON Structure
Here’s an example of what the JSON data looks like for a province:

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Bali",
    "cities": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "Denpasar",
            "districts": [
                {
                    "id": "1",
                    "name": "Denpasar Selatan",
                    "villages": [
                        {
                            "id": "1",
                            "name": "Pedungan"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
